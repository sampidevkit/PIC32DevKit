    Microchip Technology Inc.

  File Name:
    spi3.h

  @Summary
    This is the generated header file for the SPI3 driver using PIC24 / dsPIC33 / PIC32MM MCUs

  @Description
    This header file provides APIs for driver for SPI3.
    Generation Information :
        Product Revision  :  PIC24 / dsPIC33 / PIC32MM MCUs - 1.170.0
        Device            :  PIC32MM0256GPM064
    The generated drivers are tested against the following:
        Compiler          :  XC32 v2.50
        MPLAB             :  MPLAB X v5.45
